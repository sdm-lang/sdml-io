# sdml-io source

This repository contains the source code for the SDML website [http://sdml.io/](http://sdml.io/).

The documentation is all written in [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) [org-mode](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and hosted via GitHub Pages. At this time the documentation is
generated offline and checked in so that the deployment process for Pages is a copy only.
